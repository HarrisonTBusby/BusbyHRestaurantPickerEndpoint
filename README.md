This program uses string arrays, for loops, and a randomizer to determine what you want to eat for dinner. If your responses are Asian, Fast Food, or Sit Down, then the responses will be randomized accordingly.


//Peer reviewed by:Marcel R. - The program runs exceptionally well with limited code. Makes use of arrays and sets strings equal to the random number generated based on asian, fast food, or sit down. I liked the choices and awesome work! :)
